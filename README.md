# Bubbles
An app to share anonymous ideas.

To compose a new "bubble," tap on the screen that says "tap to start an idea." Each space entered will start a new word.
When you have finished writing your idea, fling the bubble towards the top of the screen to send it to the "cloud." 

Now when any user of the app shakes their phone they will recieve any one of the bubbles in the cloud
(including their own, perhaps!) 

When they send it away, the bubble is deleted.
